### Directory structure

```r
# Report the working directory to the workspace
getwd()
```

Determine contents of the working directory

```r
dir()

# Search for .html files
dir(pattern = ".html")

# # Search for .csv files
dir(pattern = ".csv")
```

### Scripting and Debugging
If something is wrong in your code R will (sometimes helfpully) let you know through warnings and messages.

Luckily, chances are you are not the only person to have encountered the error, so you can "Google" it. 

When code will still run but at the end there will be one or more warning messages

```r
x <- c(1,2,3,4,"Red")
mean(x)
# The mean was "calculated" but it was NA because the vector is non-numeric
```

Errors cause the code to stop immediately

```r
"a" + 1
# In this example, I can not add "a" to 1 because "a" is non-numeric.
```

Strategies for correcting errors

1. Look for obvious typos, extra commas, open parenthesis, etc...

2. Use the `?help` page for the function you are trying to use

3. Google your error message. 

4. Google what you are trying to do. (How do I replace -9999 with NA?)

For practice, create this vector on your machine:

```r
length.val <- c(121,-9999, 134, 211, -9999, 165, 199, -9999)
# I want to replace the -9999 with NA but keep getting an error message
length.val(length.val == -9999) <- NA
# What is the error message?
```

### .csv data
Comma delimited files .csv files are easily imported using the command line

```r
# If you want to bring in the data, assign to an object.
fishdata <- matrix(rnorm(90), nrow = 30, ncol = 3)
fish.data <- write.csv(fishdata, file = "fishdata.csv")
fishdata <- read.csv("fishdata.csv")

# Looking at the entire data set may be cumbersome:
fishdata
```

Exploring data using the structure `str` function

```r
# Provides the structure of the data
str(fishdata)
```

Exploring data `summary`

```r
# Provides basic descriptive statistics and frequencies
summary(fishdata)
```

Examine data using head and tail function

```r
# View the first 6 rows of data
head(fishdata) 
# View the last 6 rows
tail(fishdata) 
# Names of columns
names(fishdata)
```

Many, many data types can be imported...

+ .ncdf files

+ .shp files

+ .hdf files

+ .xls

+ many, many other proprietary data types...

Specialized data import often requires specialized packages

+ foreign

+ XLConnect

+ RODBC

+ many others and likely one or more suits your specialized needs.

Native files in .RData.

+ There are a suite of functions that can be used to work with these files.

Excercises

+ How many .csv files are in your current directory?
