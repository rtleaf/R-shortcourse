### Question 01

I get warning messages when I try to assign an object that starts with '01'. I know you talked about this in class on Monday but unfortunately I can't remember if there was a solution to this problem.

+ Yes, this was my mistake. I have revised the assignment tab to streamline the naming for you and me. See the update, this should run fine with the new naming convention that I have requested.

### Question 02

The other question regards downloading the 'datasets' package to get the mtcars data. Whenever I try to get 'datasets' I get a warning message that says "Warning in install.packages: package 'datasets' is not available (for R version 3.6.2)" and "package 'datasets' is a base package, and should not be updated." RStudio recommended I download RTools to try to help the problem but it didn't work. Do you have any advice as to how to fix this?

+ I recommend google search engine on warnings and error messages. A search to this effect would show that you have this package on your machine. Type 'mtcars' into your console, if you see data, then you have the package installed. 

### Question 03

I'm having trouble with my console. I don't have the other panes, including the Environment pane and the script/console pane I'm not sure about the name. I tried figuring it out but to no avail. Can you help me how to restore this? I attached a photo of how my R console looks like upon opening.

+ You are not using Rstudio, you are using R's built in console. You need to review the course material found here for installing RStudio.

### Question 04

Should I use the assignement operator?

+ See this blog post: https://colinfay.me/r-assignment/

### Question 05

I wanted to let you know that I will have to sign out of our zoom session today a little early at 5. 

+ I leave your learning to you and want to be considerate of your busy research schedule and assistantship duties, attend class as little or much as you like.

### Question 06

"Efficient R programming" helped me immensely with editing the .Rprofile code and understanding what it was that I was editing. I figure passing it along could be helpful for somebody else.

### Question 07

How to create an object, using a loop, that returns c(5, 8, 11, 14) - Zach's solution

```{r, eval=FALSE}
n.vect <- c() 
for (i in seq(from = 3, to = 12, by = 3)){
  n.vect[i / 3] <- i + 2
}
```

### Question 08

What is one solution to the "loops excercise" - Zach's solution

```{r, eval=FALSE}
n  <-  4
n.val  <-  0
for (i in 1:n){
  n.val  <-  n.val  +  (i / (i + 1))
}
```
